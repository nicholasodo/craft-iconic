# Craft Iconic
As of version 2.5, Craft now ships with Redactor II. Although greatly improved from the first version, it removed the WYSIWYG icons in place of text.
Iconic adds them back via Font Awesome!

## Installation
1. Download & unzip the file and place the `iconic` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git@github.com:picdorsey/craft-iconic.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
4. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
5. The plugin folder should be named `iconic` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.
